  <p>This app is designed to test Google Books API with Angular JS. The code is kept minimal to allow for customization. The concept is you 
  search a book from the Google Books API database and then view reviews for that book. </p>
  <p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="#/info" role="button">Start Searching for Books!</a></p>
